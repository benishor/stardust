__{project}__ also exposes a list of easing functions as described by http://robertpenner.com/easing/penner_chapter7_tweening.pdf[Robert Penner]. Easing equations should be used to smooth out parameter changes in order to make them feel more _human_.

Here is the list of math related functions currently exposed to script:

'''

===== easeInCubic(time, startValue, changeInValue, duration)
[[img-easeInCubic]]
.easeInCubic
image::easing/easeInCubic.png[easeInCubic, , ,float="right"]

Returns the current value smoothed by cubic easing according to the given parameters.

time:: the time at which the parameter must be evaluated
startValue:: the value that the parameter must have when time is 0
changeInValue:: the difference that will be applied to `startValue` when _done_
duration:: the amount of time the transition will take

Both `time` and `duration` parameters may use any measurement unit as long as it is consistent for both. This means you can safely use _seconds_ for all time dependent easing parameters since that is what `onUpdate()` offers.

'''

===== easeOutCubic(time, startValue, changeInValue, duration)
[[img-easeOutCubic]]
.easeOutCubic
image::easing/easeOutCubic.png[easeOutCubic, , ,float="right"]

Returns the current value smoothed by cubic easing according to the given parameters.

time:: the time at which the parameter must be evaluated
startValue:: the value that the parameter must have when time is 0
changeInValue:: the difference that will be applied to `startValue` when _done_
duration:: the amount of time the transition will take

Both `time` and `duration` parameters may use any measurement unit as long as it is consistent for both. This means you can safely use _seconds_ for all time dependent easing parameters since that is what `onUpdate()` offers.

'''

===== easeInQuintic(time, startValue, changeInValue, duration)
[[img-easeInQuintic]]
.easeInQuintic
image::easing/easeInQuintic.png[easeInQuintic, , ,float="right"]

Returns the current value smoothed by cubic easing according to the given parameters.

time:: the time at which the parameter must be evaluated
startValue:: the value that the parameter must have when time is 0
changeInValue:: the difference that will be applied to `startValue` when _done_
duration:: the amount of time the transition will take

Both `time` and `duration` parameters may use any measurement unit as long as it is consistent for both. This means you can safely use _seconds_ for all time dependent easing parameters since that is what `onUpdate()` offers.

'''

[[img-easeOutQuintic]]
.easeOutQuintic
