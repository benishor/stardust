Here is the list of functions currently offered by the lua `Level` table:

'''

===== Level.finish()
Triggers the end of the current playing level.

'''

===== Level.pause()
Pauses the flow of the current level. This will have the effect of effectively stopping the advance of the level script _and_ smoothly stop the scrolling of the background starfield. The current active entities will remain however active.

This state will persist until the level is resumed.

'''

===== Level.resume()
Resumes the flow of the current level which was previously paused with a call to <<Level.pause()>>. The level script will resume its advance and the background starfield will smoothly resume its scrolling.
