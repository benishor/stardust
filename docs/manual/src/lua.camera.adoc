Here is the list of functions currently offered by the lua `Camera` wrapper:

===== Camera.shake(amount)
Adds the provided `amount` shake to the camera, simulating the viewer being hit by something. The shaking amount decreases in time if no more shaking amount is added.

[NOTE]
====
Subsequent calls to `Camera.shake()` do not replace the existing camera shaking amount but rather add together for a cumulative effect. In other words, the more damage you take, the more shaky things become.
